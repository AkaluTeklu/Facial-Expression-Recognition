This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Network in facial expression recognition tasks, showcasing their performance on both static datasets and real-world, dynamic scenarios captured via webcam.

Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is implemented in both a predefined dataset and a real-time scenario using a webcam. The project leverages the FER2013 dataset, sourced from Kaggle, which consists of 28,709 images for training and 7,170 images for testing.
